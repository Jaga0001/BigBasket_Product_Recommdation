# BigBasket Product Recommandation Using Machine Learning

To develop a basic product recommendation system for BigBasket using machine learning, the process entails collecting and preprocessing customer data, including product description and ratings, followed by feature engineering to derive meaningful insights. Model selection involves choosing between collaborative filtering, content-based, or hybrid approaches, with training and evaluation assessing the model's performance. Once deployed, the system generates real-time recommendations based on user behavior, requiring ongoing monitoring and maintenance for continuous improvement.



## Process:

    1. Data Collection: Gather customer purchase, browsing, and rating data.

    2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and format the data.
    
    3. Feature Engineering: Create new features like purchase frequency.

    4. Model Selection: Choose between collaborative filtering, content-based, or hybrid methods.

    5. Training: Train the chosen model using the data.

    6. Evaluation: Assess model performance with metrics like precision and recall.

    7. Deployment: Put the model into production for real-time recommendations.

    8. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously update and improve the system.
